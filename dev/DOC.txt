Notable differences from original game

GAMEPLAY
- Monster patterns not reproducted perfectly but the tactics are the same.
- Amoeba and MagicWall timers are not parameters of the map but the same value for all levels.
- Amoebas growth rate is based on a slightly randomized timer, not a random roll each frame.
  All cells tend to grow together.

GFX
- Trapped amoeba are not animated, so their trapped state is clearly visible.

SFX
- Amoeba only make sounds when growing.
- MagicWall only make sounds when activated/deactivated.
